# Coding Assignment 3: Analyze Game Data

## Introduction

The last coding assignment asks you to implement any best classifier for analyzing commercial online-game data. It is pretty similar to CA2 such as using regression models or classification models. The competition web page is here: https://gist-leaderboard.com/competition/1

You can use either your implementation of other regressors or tune the outputs of libraries implemented in scikit-learn, please get the best performing number.

If you use your implementation to win the competition, we will give you big extra credits.

**What to submit (Push to your github classroom):** 
- in `code` directory (folder): All of the python files you have used for competition
- `report.pdf` file that answers all the written questions in this assignment (denoted by `"REPORT#:"` in this documentation).

<!-- **Evaluation:** Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please do not change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's output -- will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work. -->

**Academic Dishonesty:** We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.

**Getting Help:** You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help. Office hours, class time, and Piazza are there for your support; please use them. We want these projects to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help unless you ask.

### Code Quality (10%)

We will review your code and judge the quality of the code. Main criteria are as follows:

- Rich comments
- Well named variables and functions
- Well organized class structure

---
### Competition Standing (30%)

We will quantify your standing in the leaderboard.


---
### Report (60%)

We will evaluate the quality of your approach (either using existing library functions or your own implementation) and quality of report. Please compose your report by the following format. **Note**: You can add more sections but these sections must be included.

`Introduction and Related Work`: Brief overview of your approach, some background knowledge and related work.

`Approach`: Describe your approach for the competition entry in detail.

`Experimental Results`: Show your results by plots, graphs and table. Discuss pros and cons of your approach.

`Conclusion`: Summary of the report.
